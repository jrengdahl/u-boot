	  If true, execute U-boot code in-place from flash ROM.
	  Do not relocate the code and read-only data to RAM.
	  The .data and .bss sections must be located in RAM.
	  The .data section will be initialized from a ROM copy.

	  If defined, this is the address in RAM of the global data pointer.
	  For most targets the global data pointer is held in a reserved
	  CPU register. If the register is needed for something else, the
	  pointer can be stored in a known fixed RAM location. This costs
	  two memory-referencing instructions for reference to global data,
	  but it frees up a CPU register for use by application programs.
